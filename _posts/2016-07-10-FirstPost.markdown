## Learning Statistics with R

During early summer I taught a module on statistical programming with [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) as part of a course on statistical methods. <br>
The course has now finished but I believe that some of the material which I prepared can still be of use and have therefore decided to recycle parts of it in a series of blog posts.

Instead of recreating the course, these posts will focus on individual topics and are not meant to teach programming with *R* from the beginning. <br>
<sub>If you are searching for a basic introduction into *R* such as [this one](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) you should have a look at [r-project.org/other-docs.html](https://www.r-project.org/other-docs.html).</sub>

The code I am presenting is nevertheless often densely commented for educational purposes and should thus be easy to follow.

### Software

In addition to basic [R](https://www.r-project.org/) I also recommend the use of the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) user interface which makes data-analysis pleasant. 

Using *RStudio* will furthermore allow you to use and create [R Markdown files](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) which are a great way to combine data analysis and documentation. 
I might sometimes release *R-Markdown* files together with posts on R in the future as well.
